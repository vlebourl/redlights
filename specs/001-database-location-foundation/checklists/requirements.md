# Specification Quality Checklist: Database & Location Infrastructure

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-31
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)
**Branch**: 001-database-location-foundation

---

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
  - **Status**: PASS - Spec focuses on capabilities, not implementation
  - **Evidence**: Uses terms like "System must store" not "Room database must persist"
  
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
  - **Status**: PASS - Emphasizes data reliability, user trust, route optimization
  - **Evidence**: Problem statement clearly articulates user needs and pain points
  
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
  - **Status**: PASS - Uses personas (Sarah, Marco, Lisa), business outcomes
  - **Evidence**: Avoids technical jargon, explains concepts in user terms
  
- [x] All mandatory sections completed
  - **Status**: PASS - All template sections present and comprehensive

---

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
  - **Status**: PASS - Zero clarification markers in specification
  
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
  - **Status**: PASS - Each FR has clear, measurable acceptance criteria
  - **Example**: "System must obtain device position updates every 1 second"
  
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
  - **Status**: PASS - All 7 criteria have specific metrics
  - **Examples**:
    - "100% of completed rides are saved successfully"
    - "Position updates maintain accuracy within 10 meters for 95% of conditions"
    - "Users can access ride history within 1 second"
  
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
  - **Status**: PASS - No mention of Room, SQLite, FusedLocationProvider
  - **Evidence**: Focuses on user-observable outcomes, not system internals
  
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
  - **Status**: PASS - 3 primary scenarios + 4 edge cases = 7 total scenarios
  - **Coverage**: First ride, multiple rides, background tracking, crashes, storage, GPS loss, long rides
  
- [x] Edge cases are identified
  - **Status**: PASS - 4 edge cases with expected behaviors
  - **List**: Force close, storage full, GPS loss, long rides
  
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
  - **Status**: PASS - "Out of Scope" lists 10 excluded items
  - **Evidence**: Clearly states UI, map viz, navigation NOT included
  
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified
  - **Status**: PASS - 7 assumptions, 5 technical constraints, 3 business constraints
  - **Evidence**: Comprehensive coverage of platform, device, user assumptions

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
  - **Status**: PASS - 7 core FRs + 2 optional FRs, each with specific criteria
  - **Example FR5**: "Must obtain position updates every 1 second" + "Must filter accuracy >50m"
  
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
  - **Status**: PASS - Primary scenario (Sarah's commute) covers full lifecycle
  - **Coverage**: Start ride → track → detect stops → save → retrieve
  
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
  - **Status**: PASS - 18 acceptance criteria map to 7 success criteria
  - **Alignment**: Each success criterion has corresponding acceptance checklist items
  
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification
  - **Status**: PASS - Maintains business/user perspective throughout
  - **Evidence**: No code, no technical architecture details in requirements

## Validation Summary

**Overall Status**: ✅ **APPROVED - READY FOR PLANNING**

**Strengths**:
1. Comprehensive user scenarios with personas
2. Clear, measurable success criteria
3. Well-defined data entities and relationships
4. Thorough edge case coverage
5. Strong separation of concerns (what vs how)

**Recommendations for Planning Phase**:
1. Consider database indexing strategy for performance requirements
2. Plan for migration strategy as schema evolves
3. Address background service lifecycle management
4. Define monitoring/logging for location accuracy metrics

## Notes

- Specification is complete and unambiguous
- No clarifications needed before proceeding
- Ready for `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation plan
- All quality gates passed on first review

**Next Step**: Run `/speckit.plan` to create technical implementation plan
