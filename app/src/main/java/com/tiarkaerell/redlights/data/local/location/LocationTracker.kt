 * Low-level interface for GPS location tracking

 * location service status, and coordinate location update callbacks.

 * Note: This is an internal data layer interface. The domain layer

 * Threading: All operations use appropriate coroutine dispatchers
 * Error Handling: Throws exceptions for permission/service errors
