# Keystore Properties - PRODUCTION
# This file contains sensitive information and should NEVER be committed to git
# It's already in .gitignore

# OPTION 1: Use environment variables (recommended)
# Set these in your shell profile (~/.zshrc or ~/.bash_profile):
#   export REDLIGHTS_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD="your-password"
# Then leave these blank or delete this file

# OPTION 2: Store passwords here (less secure but convenient)
# Uncomment and fill in if you prefer local file storage

# Path to your keystore file (relative to project root)
storeFile=app/redlights-production.jks

# Keystore password - LEAVE BLANK to use environment variable
storePassword=*q9M3Fgi0S2As

# Key alias
keyAlias=redlights-release

# Key password - LEAVE BLANK to use environment variable
keyPassword=*q9M3Fgi0S2As
